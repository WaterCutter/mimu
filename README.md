## Algorithm Descriptions

### Proportional Navigation Guidance (PNG)

• The interceptor's flight direction changes proportionally to the line-of-sight angle between the missile and the interceptor  

• Simple and effective, suitable for most conventional interception scenarios  

• Average interception time: 4.2 seconds  

• Success rate: 82%  

### Optimal Guidance (OG)

• Calculates the interception path with minimal energy consumption using optimization algorithms  

• Uses numerical methods to find the optimal solution  

• Particularly suitable for high-value target precision interception  

• Average interception time: 3.5 seconds  

• Success rate: 94%  

### Adaptive Proportional Navigation Guidance (APNG)

• Dynamically adjusts guidance parameters by monitoring target movement characteristics in real-time  

• Automatically optimizes tracking strategy when the target performs high-maneuverability turns  

• Improves interception probability for maneuvering targets  

• Average interception time: 3.1 seconds  

• Success rate: 97%  

### Swarm Interception Algorithm (SIA)

• Uses multiple interceptors working together to intercept the target  

• Intelligently allocates interception paths and target points to form an interception net  

• Extremely high success rate for high-speed and high-maneuverability targets  

• Average interception time: 2.8 seconds  

• Success rate: 99%
